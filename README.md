## Description

This is a personal site for my family cookout. It is a blog-ish type app with the ability for users to post pictures to be included in the slideshow for our annual family cookout. I did have it setup with registration and the ability to change email and reset forgotten passwords, which you can ```git checkout normal-auth``` to use. But I had a lack of family members registering accounts so I switched to use "Facebook Login" authentication to make it easier for them to contribute.
